           One stupid party. One stupid boy. One stupid kiss. And my life was virtually over.

           Tessa McCaide has a unique talent for getting into trouble. Then again, it is not easy for a girl with psychic visions to ignore what she sees. Luckily Tessa and her family are leaving California and moving halfway across the country, giving her the perfect opportunity to leave her reputation as Freaky Tessa behind.

           But Tessa does not realize that kissing the wrong guy in her new Texas town could land her in far more trouble than she ever imagined. Like being forced to attend St. Ailbe's Academy, a secret boarding school for werewolves.

           Even if the wrong guy did accidentally turn her into a shapeshifter and doom her to attending the weirdest high school ever, Tessa cannot help her growing attraction to the mysterious Dastien Laurent.

           When vampires attack St. Ailbe's and her visions pinpoint an enemy in their midst, Tessa realizes that boy drama and her newfound canine tendencies might just be the least of her problems.

          Jason has a problem. He does not remember anything before waking up on a school bus holding hands with a girl. Apparently she is his girlfriend Piper, his best friend is a kid named Leo, and they are all students in the Wilderness School, a boarding school for bad kids. What he did to end up here, Jason has no idea except that everything seems very wrong.

          Piper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, and her vivid nightmares reveal that he is in terrible danger. Now her boyfriend does not recognize her, and when a freak storm and strange creatures attack during a school field trip, she, Jason, and Leo are whisked away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood. What is going on?

          Leo has a way with tools. His new cabin at Camp Half-Blood is filled with them. Seriously, the place beats Wilderness School hands down, with its weapons training, monsters, and fine looking girls. What is troubling is the curse everyone keeps talking about, and that a camperâ€™s gone missing. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist they are all including Leo related to a god.

        It is been almost a year since eighteen year old Ella Rodriguez was in a car accident that left her crippled, scarred, and without a mother. After a very difficult recovery, she's been uprooted across the country and forced into the custody of a father that abandoned her when she was a young child. If Ella wants to escape her father's home and her awful new stepfamily, she must convince her doctors that she's capable, both physically and emotionally, of living on her own. The problem is, she is not ready yet. The only way she can think of to start healing is by reconnecting with the one person left in the world who has ever meant anything to her. Her anonymous Internet best friend, Cinder. ... Hollywood sensation Brian Oliver has a reputation for being trouble. There's major buzz around his performance in his upcoming film The Druid Prince, but his management team says he would not make the transition from teen heartthrob to serious A list actor unless he can prove he has left his wild days behind and become a mature adult. In order to douse the flames on Brian's bad-boy reputation, his management stages a fake engagement for him to his co star Kaylee. Brian isn't thrilled with the arrangement or his fake fiancee but decides he will suffer through it if it means he will get an Oscar nomination. Then a surprise email from an old Internet friend changes everything.
